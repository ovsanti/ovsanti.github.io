    <p class="ch1"> Before the creation of The Elders, The Knights were a collection of knights spanning throughout the Siege in 2017-2018. The members were diverse in terms of culture, economy, and governance, representing various ethnicities and social classes. Despite their differences, they united under a common cause during the tumultuous Siege Era, finding solace and camaraderie. The Knights' stronghold was their virtual realm, where they thrived and strategized, honing their skills and forming strong bonds. Their interactions extended beyond; they organized themselves through local assemblies, discussing tactics, sharing resources, and making collective decisions to navigate the challenges of the Siege Era. </p>
